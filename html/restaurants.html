    <h2>A vegan day in Brighton</h2>

  <p id='intro'><b>Let's walk you through a day of delicious vegan food in Brighton!</b><br/>
  <small>This is by no means an exhaustive list, but definitely a useful guide to make the most of your day.</small></p>

    <h3><a href="http://www.42juice.com/">42 Juice</a></h3>
    <p><b>9am:</b> Start your morning on a fruity note.<br />
    This small caf√© in the Lanes presses fresh smoothies and juices. They have a wide variety of flavours and they also make amazing smoothie bowls! Must try.</br>
    You can enjoy your drink with healthy cakes and bars, granola or mini-doughnuts!</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/HappyMakiUk/">Happy Maki Sushi</a></h3>
    <p><b>12pm:</b> Lunch time! And you're looking for something quick, filling but still delicious.<br />
    Happy Maki Sushi comes in very handy. Head down to the sea front to grab your sushi burrito. They offer chicken and duck substitutes, tofu fritters and sweet potato fries! So many exotic flavours to delight any vegan. My personal favourite is still the Avocado Kiss: it's simply too creamy! Enjoy yours indoors or on the beach nearby.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.sixbrighton.com/">SIX Brighton</a></h3>
    <p><b>1pm:</b> But maybe you fancied something different for lunch? Sitting indoors in a cosy setting, taking your time to enjoy high quality food...<br />
    Well, SIX is the place you're looking for! It is not obvious to find it when you're new to Brighton, but it's definitely one of my top recommendations. You can enjoy a late brunch, nourishing bowls and more refined plates. This caramelized ginger tofu... or this houmous and avocado sourdough! There will definitely be an option for you, but make sure to specify vegan. This restaurant offers something for everyone so it's a great place to take your friends and family.<br />
    Have a look at their website and menus, I'm sure you'll be coming back for breakfast tomorrow.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://purezza.co.uk/">Purezza</a></h3>
    <p><b>6pm:</b> Finally dinner time! Something rich, soft, authentic ... that's all you crave: a napolitian pizza!<br />
    Purezza is a blessing. Honnestly, this is my favourite pizza place in town, vegan and non-vegan alike. The sourdough is soft and gooey, the pizza does not make you feel too heavy, this vegan cheese actually melts and tastes like cheese! And this is only the classic margherita. Have a look at their unconventional range of toppings: from BBQ tofu to smoked mozarella. All these combinations are unique and most of them include a lot of vegetables. I still have so many to try...<br />
    Make sure to book a table if you're in a large group, or alternatively come early to avoid a disappointment.<br />
    Finally, if you have the chance, try the Oreo pizza (as a dessert or a whole meal if you want). This homemade nutty nutella paired with the gooey dough... You get the idea.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://www.foodforfriends.com/">Food for Friends</a></h3>
    <p><b>7pm:</b> What is the most exquisite place to have dinner in Brighton?<br />
    Food for Friends is a vegeterian and vegan-friendly restaurant in the Lanes. They serves uniquely creative dishes (and pretty decadent desserts). On a date or for a celebration, this is the perfect to take them. Hence a must try if you're coming to Brighton for the first time!</p>
