  <h2>A day of vegan food in Brighton</h2>

  <p>Let's walk you through your day of delicious vegan food in Brighton!</p>

    <h3><a href="http://www.42juice.com/">42 Juice</a></h3>

    <p>9am: Start your morning on a fruity note.<br />
    This small caf√© in the Lanes presses fresh smoothies and juices. They have a wide variety of flavours and they also make amazing smoothie bowls! Must try.</br>
    You can enjoy your drink with healthy cakes and bars.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/HappyMakiUk/">Happy Maki Sushi</a></h3>
    <img src="../images/happy_maki_sushi.jpg">
    <p>1pm: Lunch time! And you're looking for something quick, filling but still delicious.<br />
    Happy Maki Sushi comes in very handy. Head down to the sea front to grab your sushi burrito. They offer chicken and duck substitutes, tofu fritters and sweet potato fries! So many exotic flavours to delight any vegan. My personal favourite is still the Avocado Kiss: it's simply too creamy! Enjoy yours indoors or on the beach nearby.</p>
